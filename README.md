# Python-IOT-Project
Smart Home System developed by me using various components such as a PIR sensor, LDR sensor, LED, buzzer and a doorlock connected to a Raspberry Pi. The data collected is sent to Firebase and a mobile app to control the system was created using Android studio.

This project showcased my IOT knowledge and programming skills, as well as my ability to innovate. 

Video demonstration of the Smart Home System in action is attached.
